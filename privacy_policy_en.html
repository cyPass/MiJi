<div>Effective Date: <strong>June 30, 2025</strong></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><i>MiJi</i> is an app developed by <i>Dayi Studio</i> ("we").  
When you use our app, we may collect and process certain information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information, and your rights in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Important: This app works completely offline. We do not upload any data to servers, nor share data with third parties. All data is processed and stored locally on your device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By using this app, you agree to this privacy policy.</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at: <strong>cy_password@outlook.com</strong></p>

<h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
<strong>1.1 Principles</strong>
<p>We follow the principles of legality, necessity, and data minimization. All information is processed locally on your device. <strong>We do not transmit, share, or store any data online or on external servers.</strong></p>

<strong>1.2 Specific Scenarios</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Password Management:</strong> User-set passwords are encrypted using PBKDF2 and stored in a secure area on your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Fingerprint/Face recognition is handled via your system's biometric API. <strong>We do not receive or store any biometric data.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data Security</h2>
<strong>2.1 Storage Method and Duration</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Data is encrypted using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256. Encryption keys are securely stored in the Android Keystore.</li>
  <li>Your data remains on your device indefinitely unless you manually delete it or uninstall the app.</li>
</ul>

<strong>2.2 Storage Permission</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Storage permission is required only if you manually export local backup data. The app does not access storage without your action.</li>
</ul>

<strong>2.3 Auto-Erase Protection</strong>
<ul>
  <li>For added security, if the password is entered incorrectly for <strong>3 consecutive days</strong> (reset upon successful login), the app will automatically erase all local data. This action is irreversible and optional.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. User Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
<strong>3.1 Your Rights</strong>
<p>Because all data is local, you have full control:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>View / Copy / Edit / Delete:</strong> Use in-app options to manage local data.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes all data and revokes consent.</li>
  <li><strong>Report Issues:</strong> Contact us at cy_password@outlook.com if you encounter problems.</li>
</ul>

<strong>3.2 Your Responsibilities</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Lost passwords cannot be recovered via third parties.</li>
  <li>Device theft or physical access may compromise your data.</li>
  <li>When exporting data, ensure the storage medium is secure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Additional Terms</h2>
<strong>4.1 Policy Updates</strong>
<ul>
  <li>When this policy is updated, we will notify users via in-app notifications or update logs. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the new policy.</li>
</ul>

<strong>4.2 Children's Privacy</strong>
<ul>
  <li>This app is not intended for children under 13. Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, it poses no specific risk to minors. Guardians are advised to monitor children's use if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<strong>4.3 Disclaimer</strong>
<p>We have implemented reasonable technical measures to protect your data. However, we are not responsible for any data loss or leak caused by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User's failure to follow security advice;</li>
  <li>Device system vulnerabilities or unforeseen circumstances;</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Compliance with Data Protection Laws</h2>
